# Project-4
Subscription App, React frontend, Django backend

### Purpose
My SubApp is an application for assisting users with managing all of their current subscriptions ranging from Microsoft 365, Netflix/Hulu, to Sirius XM apps.
Subscription based services are a huge part of most people's lives including work and personal time. With so many different options
all ranging from small to large costs its hard to keep up with what you're actually subscribed to at times. This app is designed to help you manage that and the cost
of all of your subscriptions all in one.

### Audience
This app benefits mostly users with multiple apps like Disney #, Xbox Game Pass and so many more. Usually once you go over about 5 app,
maybe 10 if you have twich subscriptions it really becomes a hassle to remember everything you're subbed to. People with only 1-2 subscriptions 
won't have as much benefit as someone juggling more subscriptions.
